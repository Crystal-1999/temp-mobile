When you use a temporary number for online verification, the service sends the verification code to this temporary number instead of your personal phone. You can then view the code through the temporary number service's platform, complete your verification, and discard the number when you're done.",

This creates a clean separation between your personal information and the online services you interact with.",
          "The technology behind temporary phone numbers involves virtual number providers that maintain pools of phone numbers from different carriers and countries. When you request a temporary number, the service assigns you one from their pool. All SMS messages sent to that number are captured by the service and made available to you through their web interface or API."
